# Pleated-Surgical-Mask-Machine
This is a DIY machine designed to automate production of surgical masks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's been developed at Artisan's Asylum, a non-profit makerspace in Somerville MA. 

Goal: Design an open source machine to automate production of surgical masks which approach or reach the ASTM-F2100-19 standard in response to COVID-19.

Strategy: This machine will be broken up into modules. Modular design allows for development flexibility and redundancy. It also allows production to begin with temporary manual labor while development is completed. This will additionally allow for flexibility in deployment when different tools and materials must be used. This machine must be deployed yesterday in order to meet the needs of the medical community.

Design Criteria:
Do not try to exactly reproduce surgical masks - it is impractical to meet the quality afforded by an industrial process. 
Consider the 80/20 rule: If an 80% solution is viable in a significant fraction of use cases, we can get away with doing only 20% of the work.
Use commodity hardware.
Preference is given to components likely to be stocked in a well equipped shop.

Module Requirements:
Non woven material infeed
Should be spring loaded to provide back pressure
Adjustments for position and tracking
Pleat former
Form 3 evenly spaced 12mm pleats
Symetric folding to minimize binding and tracking issues.

Nose clip infeed
Edge folder
Transverse heat sealer
Transverse cutter
Ear loop attachment
Top and bottom seal
Motor drive
(optional) binning/stacking

Module Development:
